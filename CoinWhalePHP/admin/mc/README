===== About =====
This example expands on the "simple" form a bit by showing how you can pass 
your custom Merge Vars when subscribing someone via the API.

===== Using this Example =====
1)  Unzip the whole package and drop it into a directory on a PHP 4+ enabled 
    webserver.

2)  Edit the "inc/store-address.php" file:
    Line 24: replace "your_apikey" with an API Key retrieved from here:
				http://admin.mailchimp.com/account/api/
    
    Line 27: replace "my_list_unique_id" with the List Unique Id obtained by
    		 going to:
    		 	 http://admin.mailchimp.com/lists/
			 Click the "settings" link for the list - the Unique Id is at the 
    		 bottom of that page. 

	Line 34 - 39: 
		Replace/change/remove the array keys (FNAME, etc.) for the Merge Fields
		setup on your list that the form should pass.
		
		You can define the names of each merge variable in for your lists by
		going to:
			http://admin.mailchimp.com/lists/
		Click the "list settings" link for the list, then go to the
		"Merge tags for personalization" link
	
3) Try it!


===== Usage Notes =====
This example uses MailChimp's MCAPI wrapper. As such, when comparing the 
documentation available online to it, you should ignore the $api_key 
parameter - the API wrappers we offer automatically handle that after you login
once.
