    <h2>How it will work:</h2>
	<ul class="featured">
    <li>What you get: Paying Users (and money, but thats more of a bonus, the real value is in the whales.)</li>
    <li>What the whales get: Awesome discount at your game + 2 other games. </li>
    <li>Price: Whatever we decide. Higher price gets higher quality spenders. Lower price gets more spenders.</li>
    <li>Promotion: All 3 games promote the coinwhale deal to their users (newsletter/fan update/in-game banner/etc). CoinWhale will advertise the deal to our users, our affiliates will do mailings and ppc ads. This means you get 2-3X the users in as you send out, because everyone promotes the deal equally.</li>
    <li>Payment: 20% of all sales +10% extra on referrals that you send directly from your marketing efforts on your game.</li>
    </ul>
